# Grand Theft Auto VI - Hype

A little project to test some new things. It is made up of a chronological frieze listing the events which so far gives
us real clues as to the progress of the project and its release date.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager (`pnpm install` or `yarn install` or `npm install` ).
3. Run the development server with `pnpm start` or `yarn start` or `npm start`.
4. Feel free to modify it or anything you want

This project is a fork of this [Starter](https://github.com/Alexandre-RICHARD/starter-vite-react-redux_toolkit-typescript_scss) that i made. You'll find all the information on these characteristics in the readme.
